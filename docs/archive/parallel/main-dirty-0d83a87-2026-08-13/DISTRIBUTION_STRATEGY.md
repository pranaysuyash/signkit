# Distribution Strategy for Signature Extractor

## Build Options

### Option 1: Local Build (Current Mac Only)

Build for your current architecture:

```bash
./build-tools/build_distribution.sh current
```

**Result:**

- ✅ Works on your Mac (Apple Silicon)
- ❌ Won't work on Intel Macs
- **Use for:** Personal testing, friends with similar Macs

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Both Architectures)

Build both versions automatically using GitHub Actions:

1. **Create a release tag:**

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build Intel version (on macos-13 runner)
   - Build ARM64 version (on macos-14 runner)
   - Create DMG files for both
   - Attach them to GitHub Release

**Result:**

- ✅ Works on ALL Macs (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Reproducible builds
- **Use for:** Product launch, distribution

### Option 3: Cloud Build Service

Use services like:

- **CircleCI** - Has Intel and ARM64 macOS runners
- **Travis CI** - macOS build support
- **Bitrise** - Mobile/desktop app CI/CD

## Recommended Approach for Launch

### Phase 1: Local Testing (Today)

1. Build ARM64 version locally:

   ```bash
   ./build-tools/build_macos.sh
   ```

2. Test thoroughly on your Mac

3. Share with friends who have Apple Silicon Macs

4. Gather feedback

### Phase 2: CI/CD Setup (Before Public Launch)

1. **Set up GitHub Actions** (already configured in `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`)

2. **Create a release tag:**

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0-beta -m "Beta release"
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta
   ```

3. **Wait for builds** (takes ~10-15 minutes)

4. **Download both DMGs** from GitHub Releases

5. **Test both versions:**
   - ARM64: Test on your Mac
   - Intel: Ask a friend with Intel Mac, or use a VM

### Phase 3: Distribution

Upload both DMGs to Gumroad with clear instructions:

```
Choose your version:

🔵 Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
   Download: SignatureExtractor_ARM64.dmg
   For: Macs with Apple M-series chips (2020 or newer)

🔵 Intel
   Download: SignatureExtractor_Intel.dmg
   For: Macs with Intel processors (before 2020)

Not sure? Check: Apple menu  → About This Mac
```

## Current Build Status

| Architecture | Can Build Locally | Needs CI/CD | Compatible Macs           |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| ARM64        | ✅ Yes (your Mac) | ❌ No       | M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs          |
| Intel        | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes      | Intel Macs 2019 and older |

## Quick Decision Guide

**For Today (Local Testing):**

```bash
# Build ARM64 version
./build-tools/build_macos.sh

# Test with:
open dist/SignatureExtractor.app

# Share with friends who have Apple Silicon Macs
```

**For Launch (Next Week):**

```bash
# Push a release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Wait for GitHub Actions to build both versions
# Download from: https://github.com/pranaysuyash/signkit/releases
```

## Market Coverage

**Apple Silicon only (current local build):**

- ✅ Covers ~70% of Mac users (2020 or newer)
- ❌ Misses ~30% of Mac users (Intel Macs)

**Both versions (GitHub Actions):**

- ✅ Covers 100% of Mac users
- ✅ Professional product offering
- ✅ Future-proof

## Recommendation

### For Friends Testing (This Week)

- ✅ Build ARM64 locally
- ✅ Test with 3-5 friends with Apple Silicon Macs
- ✅ Gather feedback and fix issues

### For Product Launch (Next Week)

- ✅ Use GitHub Actions to build both versions
- ✅ Upload both DMGs to Gumroad
- ✅ Provide clear download instructions
- ✅ Reach 100% of potential customers

## Files You Need

### Already Created ✅

- `build-tools/SignatureExtractor_macOS.spec` - ARM64 build config
- `build-tools/SignatureExtractor_Intel.spec` - Intel build config
- `build-tools/build_macos.sh` - Local ARM64 builder
- `build-tools/build_distribution.sh` - Multi-arch builder
- `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

### Next Steps

1. Build ARM64 version locally (5 minutes)
2. Test thoroughly (1-2 hours)
3. Share with friends (2-3 days)
4. Fix any issues found
5. When ready: Tag release → GitHub Actions builds both → Launch!

---

**TL;DR:**

- **Today:** Build ARM64 locally, test with friends
- **Launch:** Use GitHub Actions for both Intel + ARM64
- **Simple command:** `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
